/**
 * @brief A single processing unit that can be connected with others to create intricate processing systems
 *
 * A cornerstone of "visual programming", a node is a single "function" that takes input and returns an output that can
 * be connected to other nodes. Inputs can be either user-set or retrieved from the output of another node. By joining
 * several nodes together, intricate, highly customizable, and infinitely extensible systems can be made for processing
 * data. It can also all be exposed to the user without forcing them to write code or compile anything.
 *
 * A major example in Olive is the entire rendering workflow. To render a frame, Olive will work through a node graph
 * that can be infinitely customized by the user to create images.
 *
 * This is a simple base class designed to contain all the functionality for this kind of processing connective unit.
 * It is an abstract class intended to be subclassed to create nodes with actual functionality.
